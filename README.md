# MiniESP32
A very small dev-Board for the Original ESP32
----
Since the ESP32-C3 was released I enjoyed the use of those ultra-small Dev-Boards.<br> 
Sadly there where no such Dev-Boards for the "original" ESP32 (XTENSA Dual-Core). So I created my own. <br>
The board is 25x31mm and with that only a bit bigger than the ESP32-WROOM Module (19x26mm). <br><br>

Gerber and provided .xlsx files can be used to directly upload to JLCPCB (*.xlsx-files for assembly service)<br>
If you let them only assemble the Top-Side of the PCB you can get 5 Boards assembled for ~50$. The gerber file is panelized, so each panel will give you 4 boards. 5 Panels wich 4 boards each makes ~2.5$ per board.<br>
That leaves If you with the obligation of soldering one ESP32-Wroom module as well as 2x SOT23 N-Channel Mosfets and 4x 0603 10k resistors. All of which can be ordered form Aliexpress (for the NMOS search "AO3404").
